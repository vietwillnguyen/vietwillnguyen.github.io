# About Me 

Hi, I’m Viet Nguyen, Professionally I am a software engineer with 5 years of experience across the embedded stack  — from bare-metal, RTOS, to embedded Linux devices. I’ve worked on projects from concept, prototype, development, testing, and deployment. I have spent most of my professional career in the Bay Area California, exposing me to the startup culture and tech-industry practices. My specialization has been in embedded, full-stack and automation based projects. 

Along the way, in both my profession and personal life I’ve stepped into leadership roles, helping guide teams, mentor others, manage stakeholders, and done my best to deliver products on time and at a high quality. 

I am also the founder of [Vietnam Hearts](https://www.facebook.com/vietnamhearts), a volunteer collective providing an educational, positive, and fun environment for disadvantaged children in Ho Chi Minh City. Founded just in 2025, I launched a grassroots educational volunteer group starting from 0, which provides education for 60 students and has raised over $5000 for food and supplies.

I continually look for ways to improve both professionally and personally, and create things that matter. If that aligns with you, lets get in touch.
