# Career Reflection: building digital license plates for drones at 24

In 2022, I took on a project that would define much of my year: building **Remote ID** for our drones. For those unfamiliar, Remote ID is the FAA’s new requirement—basically a digital license plate that broadcasts a drone’s identity and location in real-time. Without it, our entire fleet would be grounded. No pressure.

The project landed on my desk after a senior engineer left. I had **zero prior experience with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**, but there was no time to hesitate. I dove in—learning BLE protocols from scratch, reaching out to vendors, and prototyping under intense deadlines. The learning curve was steep, but the urgency kept me focused.

## The Challenge

This wasn’t just about writing code. It was about orchestrating a **complex, cross-functional effort**:

- **Regulatory teams** to ensure FAA compliance.
- **Embedded & app engineers** for seamless firmware–app integration.
- **Hardware teams** to confirm feasibility and test physical components.
- **Executives** needing clear updates on risks, blockers, and timelines.

Every moving part depended on the others, and delays in one area could ripple through the entire project.

## The Outcome

After two intense months, we delivered an **FAA-compliant Remote ID solution**:

- Our drones stayed in the air without regulatory disruption.
- Integration for future projects was smoother thanks to **thorough documentation**.
- Technical debt was reduced by clearly outlining system architecture and decisions.

## What I’d Do Differently

- **Involve stakeholders earlier** to clarify requirements and avoid overengineering.
- **Integrate hardware testing sooner** to catch issues before they snowball.
- **Ship a simple MVP first**, then layer on enhancements.

## Key Takeaway

This project was a reminder that sometimes the fastest way to learn is to **jump in headfirst**. When the stakes are high and the deadline is real, you discover just how much you can figure out—and how fast.

> You’d be surprised what a person with a goal and a deadline can do.
