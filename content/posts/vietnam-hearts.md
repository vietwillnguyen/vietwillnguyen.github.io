## The First Day I Almost Quit

When I first walked into that classroom in Vietnam, I barely knew a word of Vietnamese and had never taught before. My first lesson was a disaster—kids talking over me, no one paying attention, and me not understanding a thing.

I left that day seriously considering quitting.

But as I was packing up, one of the kids tugged at my sleeve and asked,  
> “Ngày mai thấy đi đạy không? (You’re coming tomorrow to teach, right?)”

That simple question kept me coming back.

## Two Months Later

Fast forward two months, and what started as me teaching eight kids by myself has grown into something much bigger. We now have a system that gives underprivileged kids access to education, food, supplies, and a positive environment for their future.

Along the way, I’ve made friends, learned more than I could have imagined, and discovered what a small group of people can achieve when they care enough to act.

## Why I Started

People often ask why I started this. The short answer: I believe it’s important to carry love forward—through ourselves and others.

This year, I’ve learned that the more you give, the more you receive. I’ve poured time, money, and effort into this project, and while there have been plenty of ups and downs, what I’ve gained in return is something I can’t put a price on. Vietnam Hearts is a project in honor for one who changed mine.

## How It All Happened

At the start of 2025, I was traveling in Vietnam and wanted to give back, but found it surprisingly hard to find volunteer opportunities.

Then I stumbled upon a local school that desperately needed teachers and supplies. I realized I could do more than just teach; I could help build something that would last.

## What We Did

- **Launched a grassroots volunteer group** – recruited and onboarded over 100 volunteers through meetups and online groups.
- **Developed a flexible curriculum** – pieced together lessons using ESL resources, Google Translate, and AI tools.
- **Handled everything from teaching to operations** – outreach, fundraising, daily logistics.
- **Bridged language and cultural gaps** – leveraged tech and international networks to make it work.

---

## The Results

- Daily English classes for **50+ underserved kids**.
- **$5,000+ raised** for school supplies and food.
- Built a **sustainable, no-cost volunteer system** that anyone can join.

---

## Lessons Learned

- Focus more on **high-leverage activities** like curriculum building, operations, and networking.
- Start with a **unified, scalable curriculum**.
- Automate volunteer onboarding and scheduling.
- Find the right people, they will help more than you think.
